A simple, powerful, and cross-platform AI client built with Flutter. It allows you to connect to any API service compatible with the OpenAI format, including your own locally deployed model services.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Universal API Support**: Easily connect to any provider compatible with the OpenAI API specification, or customize API paths through advanced settings.
- **Multiple Model Types**: Supports not only language model chats but also integrates support for **real-time image generation**, **asynchronous image generation (Midjourney proxy)**, and **video generation**.
- **Highly Customizable**:
    - **UI**: Light/dark themes, Monet color theming (Android 12+), corner radius, blur effects, font size, bubble alignment, etc.
    - **Chat**: Customize system prompts, temperature, top_p, context message count, etc.
    - **Providers**: Freely add, edit, and delete API providers and their associated models.
- **Data Management**: All data (configurations, chat history) is stored locally. Supports one-click export and import of backup data for easy migration and sharing.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Flutter, theoretically supporting Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Local-First**: All your chat history, API keys, and settings are securely stored on your device.

## ü§ù Contributing & Adapting New APIs

We welcome any form of contribution!

If you want the app to support a specific, non-standard AI provider API, please submit an **Issue** on GitHub with as much detail as possible. This will greatly help us with the adaptation.

Please include the following information in your Issue:

### 1. Language Models

```
- **Provider Name**: [e.g., My AI Service]
- **Request URL**: [e.g., https://api.my-ai.com/v1/chat]
- **Request Method**: [e.g., POST]
- **Request Headers**:
  - Content-Type: application/json
  - Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
  - [Other necessary headers]
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "model": "{MODEL_NAME}",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "..."}
    ],
    "stream": true,
    // Other parameters...
  }
  ```
- **Streaming Response Format**:
  ```
  data: {"id": "...", "choices": [{"delta": {"content": "Hello"}}]}

  data: {"id": "...", "choices": [{"delta": {"content": " world"}}]}

  data: [DONE]
  ```
- **Non-streaming Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "...",
